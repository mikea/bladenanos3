## Ordering

Microheli experience starts right from ordering: you get an e-mail saying that the package you ordered is out of stock and you’ll get it in 10 days (promise!) instead of promised 3. I contacted Microheli after 12 days of silence. Only then they shipped. 15 days total.

## Documentation

Doesn’t exist. You will get poorly executed engineering drawings. Many of them are done twice with small differences. Good luck figuring out which one is yours!

No instructions. The recommendation to use loctite everywhere contradicts loctite data sheet (metal-metal only unless plastic parts are pretreated which I doubt).

I expected more from $150+ package. 

## Assembly

Supplied screws are AWEFUL! They snap in half (!) under minimal two-finge torque. I snapped the first while trying to secure main motor. Completely renders the part useless. MH sent me a replacement.

Wasn’t able to tighten any screws at all because of a constant fear of it being snapped. Nevertheless snapped the second one while assembly barely breathing. As a result quality assembly is simply not possible: many parts will stay insecure.

Assembly process is also very frustrating and not as linear as drawings imply. E.g. back servo doesn’t fit into assembled frame. I had to dissemble the frame again to install it.

Full weight without battery: 34.8g (stock is 28.6g).

## First Flight

This thing flies like a HOG. Stock motor is severely underpowered for it. Out of fast nimble heli this becomes a very slow flier.

Since this is dubbed as a performance package, it is 100% wrong. There’s no performance gain anywhere.

Also since I’m unable (afraid) to tighten bolts it really falls apart after 2min of flight: not really secure main shaft, motor, tail boom.

Regret the conversion: I can only use it for display now or occasionally for guests to try in stability mode.

## Resume

-1 star for misleading slow shipping.
-1 star for lack of documentation.
-1 star for terrible, terrible screws.
-1 star for bad flight performance.

Total: 1 star. Waste of money.
