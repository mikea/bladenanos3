## Radio Setup & Binding

When binding a Computer based radio like a Dx9 make sure to move your rudder stick to full right rudder. If you need to rebind the included non-computer RTF controller move the rudder full left.

## Flight Modes

Flight modes are controlled through channel 5 (gear). 

100: Stability Z
0: Stability 
-100 : 3D Mode

The light is red in 3d mode, blue in either of the stability modes.

### Curves

Easiest way to control altitude is to soften your 3D throttle curve. Instead of a constant 100% throttle curve, use something like 100-90-75-90-100.



## Calibrating

To calibrate the Blade Nano S3:

1. After initialization, move the transmitter sticks to the bottom, outside corners, as shown in the illustration. (Left to lower left, right to lower right).
When the red and blue LEDs on the main control board flash slowly, calibration mode is active.
2. Release the sticks.
3. Slowly advance the throttle to bring the helicopter into a low hover. The red and blue LEDs flash rapidly to indicate the calibration process has begun. 
Hold the hover for approximately 15 seconds, using as little control input as possible to keep the helicopter steady.
4. Land the helicopter by slowly lowering the throttle.
5. After Landing, press the bind/panic button to complete the calibration process. The LED will show solid blue.
